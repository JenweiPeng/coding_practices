write a function to determine if an array of integers is monotonic
monotonic means the elements are "entirely" non-increasing or non-decreasing
for example, following array is monotonic
[-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]

if the "trend" (direction of the array) changes, then the array is not monotonic
